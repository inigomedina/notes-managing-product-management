Product Management is the systemic, holistic business management of products and services.

Although the Product Management function is included on the organization chart in many companies, the roles and expectations relegated to product managers tend to vary widely. From my experience in the field, I’ve found that companies often confuse the functions of Product Development, Project Management, and Product Management.

Product Management is deeply misunderstood, grossly marginalized, and vastly underutilized. For example, some companies create independent, deal-driven organizations in geographic regions. This structure does not provide fertile ground for product innovation. In such an environment, product managers are the fragile glue that works tirelessly to keep this function performing to meet the needs of the business.

Product Management is treated like project management. This is common in industries with mature product portfolios, in firms with IT- or software-based products, and others. In this model, individuals with the title of “product manager” handle inbound requests from Sales and outside customers. In such circumstances, these product managers are forced by the circumstances to focus on the prioritization of features and other requests based mainly on available resources or customers’ insistence that their requests are the most important. I refer to this as an Insource-Outsource Model because development is effectively “outsourced” using internal resources. Such a model prevents the product portfolio from being optimized.

Product Management is considered to be another organizational silo. This model is best described as an impenetrable “City of Silos” where functional agendas trump rational holistic business decision making. Furthermore, independent sanctions of diverse, incompatible goals typically result in ill-conceived activities and poor decision making. This can lead to products that do not contribute to the firm’s bottom line.

I believe the cause of this dysfunctional change phenomenon is that there is no universal approach to the function and purpose of Product Management. It’s not that Product Management is not being carried out. In fact, it is being performed everywhere—but in myriad different ways. With so much variation in how Product Management is performed and with no paradigms for improvement, there can be negative impacts on the organization, such as role confusion and poor interpretation or misalignment of key business processes. All in all, these dysfunctions act like heavy boat anchors, dragging down corporate efficiency.

 I believe that the most effective of these is to establish a constant and definitive Product Management structure that acts as the stable underpinning of the company.

 Among other things (depending on the type of business), this repository could include the following:

 

Competency management program information

Human resources programs for product managers

Product Management processes

Work flows, systems, templates, and other similar tools

Any method or system used to plan, execute, measure, or manage the overall performance of the Product Management organization



Product Management is the organic, interrelated ecosystem that touches, connects, and affects all functions within a company. A company exists because its products provide value to its customers in selected markets; consequently careful management of its products and portfolios is paramount. It is, then, axiomatic that the improvement of the function and performance of Product Management is essential to the success of the entire company.


In order to firmly establish the function of Product Management, leaders must build a collective clarity of purpose for Product Management that is viewed by, and bought into, across the entire organization.

In cases where criteria for progression planning were established, the top three criteria for product managers (shown below) that were selected as “extremely important” or “important” included these, in order of precedence:

Has the ability to influence others
Is a self-starter
Knows how to get things done in the organization

At the next lower level, the criteria included the following:

Market knowledge
Reputation with customers
Product knowledge
Domain and technical knowledge
Ability to achieve financial and business objectives

A third level listed a host of other criteria, including these:

Is recommended by other leaders
Helps others
Is at the top of the salary band
Has an “easy-to-get-along-with” personality
Makes task force contributions
Demonstrates company values
